# Former projects
This folder contains my old projects, from when I followed the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis"(NUMECON) in the autumn of 2021.
I will also ask Jeppe if I can upload my Exam answers :)

**IMPORTANT** The pydst package has depreciated(no longer usable) since, so the code will not run. For the course we instead use DSTAPI. Other packages used have possible also depreciated. Please tell me if you find others, so I can write it here.
