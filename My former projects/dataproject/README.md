# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Development in Danish unemployment, 2007-2020** and is about how the Danish Unemployment has changed during the period. We both look at the general picture both through the absolute number and through pct. change pr. month. We have also created a widget for looking at each municipality seperately.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. table AUF01 downloaded using pydst
2. table AUF02 downloaded using pydst

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
