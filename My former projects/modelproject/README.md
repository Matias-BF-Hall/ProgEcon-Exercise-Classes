# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Intertemporal consumer problem** and is about about a consumers consumption choices in two periods given a set of predifined parametervalues. The standard intertemporal consumption model is extended to include both a risk free rental rate and a risky rental rate with a risk premium.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
